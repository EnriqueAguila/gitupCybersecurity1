Cybersecurity Capstone Project
Cybersecurity evaluates participants' abilities to develop secure and efficient programs and unlike other hacker tools, focuses solely on the user's effort and experiences, rather than on how "well" they understand the tools and processes.
The basic categories are:
Core Concepts, which includes things like information security standards and architecture, designing for openness and having a strong centralized management system, structured audits, safety from counterfeit parts and vulnerability management
Network Defense, which includes things like secure password management, securing systems against denial of service attacks, analyzing threats, etc.
Security, which covers a wide array of tools and procedures, including authenticating users, configuring servers, and monitoring system behavior.
